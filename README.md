🦠 COVID-19 Patient Analysis: 

     This project presents an interactive COVID-19 Health & Patient Outcome Analysis built using Python, Pandas, and visualization tools.
     It focuses on understanding patient health conditions, hospitalization trends, oxygen level variations, and age-based risk patterns.
